## Supported operators
- Unary: +, -, ~
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
- Bitwise: |, ^, &, <<, >>, >>>
- Assignment: =, |=, ^=, &=, <<=, >>=, >>>=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Comment: //

## Quirks
- Unary + and - are invalid for hexadecimal numbers.
- Left shift << by more than the current bit width returns 0.
- >>> is adopted from Java. It shifts right without sign extension.
- Variable names must consist of only letters and have at most 15 characters.
- Variables do not lose their set bits when the bit width is reduced; they
  will then be overflowed.

## Option commands
- set dm [bin|hex|dec]: Change output display mode to binary, hexadecimal, or
  decimal
- set bw x: Set bit width to x that must be positive, maximum 32, and
  divisible by 4
- help: Display help
